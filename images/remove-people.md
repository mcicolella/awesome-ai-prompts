Remove all people from [piazza, via, ecc.]

The [piazza, via, ecc.] must appear completely empty.

Preserve everything else exactly as it is:

* architecture, buildings, pavement, textures, materials
* lighting, shadows, reflections
* perspective, framing, focal length
* colors, contrast, atmosphere
* signs, street furniture, plants, ground details

Do not add, modify, replace, or invent anything.

Only perform clean and realistic inpainting where people were present.

The final image must look like the original photograph taken at the same moment, with no people present.

Photorealistic result, seamless retouching, no artifacts.
